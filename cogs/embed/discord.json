        "description": "If you want your mic to sound exactly how you hear it in Voicemeeter or if you're playing sounds through your mic, go ahead and follow this (https://imgur.com/a/oyXVQfL).\n\nDon’t trust the “Check Mic” section of Discord, it won't be a good representation of how your mic sounds. Test it within our Discord with `!testmic`",

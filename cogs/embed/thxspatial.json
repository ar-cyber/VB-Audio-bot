THX Spatial Audio (virtual 7.1 surround sound) is embedded into the audio driver of some Razer headsets. To use THX Spatial Audio in combination with Voicemeeter you can:\n\n1.) Select the MME option for your headset in the desired Voicemeeter Hardware Out (A1, A2, etc.).\nYou cannot use WDM as it will bypass the audio effects provided by the driver.\n\n2.) Open Razer Synapse and set the Razer device as your default device.\n(Ex: https://imgur.com/a/Tvoi6Lk)\nChange your audio preferences in Synapse (EQ, THX Spatial Audio or Stereo, etc).\n\n3.) Reset your previously selected Voicemeeter device as your default device using Windows Sound settings. (Type \"Change system sounds\" into the windows search bar to open windows sound control panel)", "image": "https://i.imgur.com/DGJNojk.png"}}
